!See in ** the specific code that was added to the base LCA model presented in Base_LCA GitHub File

TITLE: Latent class analysis, a dicotomous approach, on 14 IDS-SR items.

  DATA: file = data.txt;

  VARIABLE:
  NAMES ARE !same as Base_LCA input file
  USEVARIABLES ARE !same as Base_LCA input file

  MISSING ARE ALL (-99);
  IDVARIABLE IS id;
  CATEGORICAL ARE ALL ;
  CLASSES = c(4);

  ANALYSIS:
      TYPE = MIXTURE;
      PROCESSORS = 6(STARTS);
      STARTS = 500 50;
      *PARAMETERIZATION = RESCOVARIANCES;*

  MODEL:
